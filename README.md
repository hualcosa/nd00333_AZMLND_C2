# overview
This is my repository for the second project of the Azure Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree.<br>
<br>
The goal of this project is to train a machine learning model for production with automl, deploy it and consume it.<br>
This same process is also done via Azure Pipelines. <br>

1. Authentication
2. Automated ML Experiment
3. Deploy the best model
4. Enable logging
5. Swagger Documentation
6. consume model endpoints
7. Create and publish a pipeline
8. writing this documentation :)

# Youtube screencast
I have made a short video going through the above steps, so you can have an even better understanding of the complete workflow.
I hope it helps!<br>

# future improvements
All the work done in the project used version 1 of azureml Python SDK, but Python SDK version 2 is already available. A good experiment would be to repeat the steps outlined above using the newest version of the API and document the differences.
